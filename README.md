# MatrixJS
A sandbox repo for web-based software implementations.
Mostly just fun demos for my website that are simple enough to be executed and visualized in a webpage.

Topics of interest (TODO list):

## 1. Graph operations

    * Ant Colony Optimization 
        - Travelling Salesman problem, fully-connected graph without node rewards
        - Maximal reward for sparsely-connected graph, finite travel capacity
        
    * Shortest Path
        - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
        - Dial's optimization of Dijkstra's for small diff. in max->min edge weight
        
## 2. Neural Networks
    
    * Basic Topologies
        - Classification of typified nodes in a planar space (regression)
        - Character identification with pre-trained model (see MNIST items in C++ repo)
        - Sketch identification with pre-trained model, convolution demonstration
    
    * Transformers
        - Demo of attention / context vector in parallel use of transformers
